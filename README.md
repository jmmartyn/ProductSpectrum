# ProductSpectrum
Code for product spectrum ansatz: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01015 <br />
Ising/product_spectrum_Ising.m approximates the thermal state of the mixed field Ising model. <br />
Ising/TFD_Ising.m approximates the thermofield double state of the mixed field Ising model. <br />
SYK/product_spectrum_and_TFD_SYK.m approximates the thermal state and the thermofield double state of the SYK model.<br />
